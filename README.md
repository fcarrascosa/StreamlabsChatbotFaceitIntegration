## Contributing

I'm by no means a professional Python developer, and I don't intend to. So there might be styling incoherency in the
code of this project. Anyway, I'm looking forward to actively maintain it and progressively adding new features.

You are very welcome to contribute to this project by any means you consider necessary: `reporting bugs`,
`requesting features` and `code conrtibuting` are an example of how you can contribute to this project.

If you want to contribute by adding code, please fork this repo and branch of the `main` branch. You can do your coding
in your branch and then submit a pull request to the upstream's `develop` branch. I will try to keep up with the pull
requests and review/include them as soon as possible.
